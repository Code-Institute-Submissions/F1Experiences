## UX

### User Goals

I expect that the majority of the users will fall into the following criteria:

- A user looking to purchase event tickets.
- A user looking for information about upcoming events.
- A site manager adding/removing information and race packages.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of events.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of tickets for each event.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a running total of my puchases.
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account to view and manage my orders.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit and remove items from my cart while shopping.
- As a user, I want to be able to pay for tickets using card payment.
